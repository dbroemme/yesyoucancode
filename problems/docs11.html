<span style="color: #40E0D0;">Challenge 11: Lottery Analysis</span>
<p style="color: #6495ED;">We are going to analyze data from a state lottery
to see how truly random the number selection is.
We have a data file with the last twenty years of Pick 4 numbers
from the Virginia state lottery that we use for our analysis.
We will read through the data and keep track of how many times
each number shows up. 
Finally we will display a report showing the distribution.<br/><br/>
The format of the DATA_FILE is as follows:</p>
<pre>
Results for Pick 4
12/20/2020; Day: 7,1,5,9; Night: 3,5,9,2
12/19/2020; Day: 7,7,9,8; Night: 2,9,4,1
12/18/2020; Day: 8,6,9,7; Night: 9,1,2,6
...
10/1/1991; Night: 5,1,5,3
9/30/1991; Night: 3,3,4,5

All information is entered manually, and is subject to human error.
Therefore, we can not guarantee the accuracy of this information.

<pre>
File.readlines(DATA_FILE).each do |line|
    line = line.chomp  # remove the carriage return
    # process the text in line
end
</pre>
<ol style="color: #CCCCFF;">
<li>Read the data file</li>
<li>For each line, split up the data into its parts</li>
<li>Keep track of the number of occurrences for each number</li>
<li>Display a list of the results</li>
