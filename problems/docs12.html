<span style="color: #40E0D0;">Challenge 12: Predicting the popularity of online articles</span>
<h2>NOTE: You must run this challenge in 'Terminal' mode.</h2>
<p style="color: #6495ED;">We are going to use research data
to help predict how popular a given online article might be.
We will use a Ruby gem, a library called decisiontree
to help make the prediction.<br/><br/>
The code is already given to you. You should try experimenting with different
variables and combinations. You can use this pattern on other data sets
as well.
