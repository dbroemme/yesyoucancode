<b>Challenge #1: Get the price of Bitcoin</b><br/>
We need to provide instructions to our friend to get
the current price of Bitcoin. However, our friend
doesn't know how to do that, so we need to tell
them explicitly. We know that there is a website
that has the data.

Our instructions are as follows:<br/><br/>
<ol>
    <li>Get the current data from the website</li>
    <li>From the data, extract the 15 min price in U.S. Dollars</li>
    <li>Tell me what the price is</li>
</ol>
